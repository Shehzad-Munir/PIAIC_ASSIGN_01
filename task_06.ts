 *
 * Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning
 * and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination,
 * "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once,
 * so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
 * Then print the name after striping the white spaces
